\section{Introduction}
Imagine you have just arrived in a restaurant, and taken a seat at a table. In order to start eating, you first ask the waiter for the menu, which he brings to you. After thinking about what you would like, you call the waiter to your table again, and tell him what you would like to eat. The waiter writes down your order, and takes it back to the restaurant kitchen, where your meal is prepared. Then, hopefully after not waiting too long, the waiter brings you your meal.
